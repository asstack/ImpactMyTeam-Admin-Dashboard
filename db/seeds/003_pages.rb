### THE CHALLENGE

The concept for Impact My Team came to being during a discussion on how best to help organisations fund products that are often over looked in Athletic Departments. The Athletic Training Room is the nucleus of any sports program yet one of the last recipients of funding.  Impact My Team was created to help change that paradigm by putting the power of crowdfunding to work for any institution.

### SOLUTION

iMPACT MY TEAM provides a simple tool for organizations to raise funds to equip their facilities with the latest equipment by engaging their community of supporters: including boosters, alumni, parents and corporate partners.   iMPACT MY TEAM will help Athletic Directors, Athletic Trainers, Coaches and Boosters set up their own fundraising campaigns to afford the equipment their athletes deserve.

## PURCHASE AGREEMENT

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. **ACCEPTANCE:** This Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) is for the purchase of the products and services listed on the first page of this Agreement ("Goods") and is the entire agreement between Impact Athletic, LLC (“Seller”) and the Purchaser of the Goods (“Purchaser”). This Agreement binds and benefits Seller and Purchaser and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, and legal representatives. Any changes to this Agreement by purchase order, lease, or other means are deemed material changes, and Seller objects to and rejects such changes. Any proposed changes by Purchaser shall not operate as Purchaser’s rejection of the terms of this Agreement if Purchaser accepts Seller’s Terms and Conditions by accepting the Goods, in which case this Agreement shall be deemed accepted by Purchaser without any additional or different terms. If this Agreement is deemed to be an acceptance by Seller of a prior offer by Purchaser, such acceptance shall be limited to the Terms and Conditions contained in this Agreement; and any additional or different terms in Purchaser’s prior offer shall be deemed material changes, which Seller objects to and rejects.  Acceptance by Purchaser occurs upon completion of inspection.

2. **PRICE:** The price(s) of the Goods are as set forth on the face of this Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided on the face of this Agreement, Seller shall be solely responsible for all shipping and handling charges, freight and insurance charges.  Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the amount of all fees, duties, licenses, tariffs, and all sales, use, privilege, occupation, excise, or other taxes or governmental assessments (such as VAT), whether federal, state, local or foreign, which are required to be paid or collected in connection with the sale of the Goods to Purchaser and shall pay the same on the terms set forth in Section 3 below based upon an invoice therefor delivered by Seller.

3. **DELIVERY:** Deliveries shall be made by Seller to Purchaser’s address as set forth on the face of this Agreement within forty-five (45) days of receipt of payment for the Goods pursuant to Section 4 below.  Deliveries shall be made F.O.B. Seller’s or Seller’s principal’s facility.

4. **PAYMENT TERMS:** Subject to Section 5 below, Purchaser must pay Seller in full for the Goods and other applicable charges provided herein within [30 days] from the date of this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to pay in full by the due date, Purchaser’s balance shall accrue interest at the rate of 1½% per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Purchaser shall pay all of Seller’s costs of collection, including attorneys’ fees, and shall not have any right of set off. Payment shall be made in United States dollars unless quoted in a different currency on the face of this Agreement.

5. **IMPACT MY TEAM:** Notwithstanding the terms set forth in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement, if this Agreement has been entered into in connection with Purchaser’s creation of a Impact My Team campaign pursuant to the Terms of Use set forth on [WEBSITE](/) (a “Campaign”), the time period in which Seller must deliver the Goods will be tolled unless and until such Campaign succeeds in raising the funds related thereto.  Upon the completion of a successful Campaign, all funds contributed to such Campaign shall immediately and irrevocably become the property of Seller as consideration for the delivery of the Goods, and Purchaser’s obligations under Section 4 shall be deemed to have been fulfilled in their entirety.  In the alternative, in the event a Campaign fails to meet its fundraising goals (by termination, expiration, or otherwise), this Agreement shall be immediately terminated in connection therewith, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any continuing rights or obligations in respect hereof.

6. **LIMITED WARRANTY:** Seller warrants for a period of two (2) years following delivery of the Goods that the Goods will be free from defects in material and workmanship.
